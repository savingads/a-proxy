# A-Proxy Development Setup Progress

## 2025-04-18: Production Deployment Workflow Implementation

- Created comprehensive production deployment workflow
  - `deploy.sh` - Automates the entire deployment process to the Digital Ocean Droplet
  - `merge-to-main.sh` - Handles the process of merging developer branch into main
  - `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Detailed documentation of the deployment process

- The deployment script handles:
  - Setting up the `/var/www/a-proxy` directory structure
  - Configuring Nginx as a reverse proxy
  - Setting up Gunicorn with proper configuration
  - Creating systemd services for both the main app and persona service
  - Proper permissions and ownership
  - Database initialization and backup
  - Comprehensive error handling and verification

- The merge script handles:
  - Safe merging of developer branch into main
  - Creating backup tags before merging
  - Commit and push management
  - Comprehensive error handling

- Documentation includes:
  - Step-by-step deployment instructions
  - Multiple deployment options (direct or remote)
  - Verification procedures
  - Rollback instructions for recovery
  - Maintenance guidelines

Next steps:
- Complete the first production deployment to the Digital Ocean droplet
- Set up automated backups for the production database
- Consider implementing CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- Add monitoring for the production environment

## 2025-04-08: Initial WSL Development Environment Setup

- Created comprehensive development environment setup documentation
  - `SETUP_DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md` - Detailed manual setup instructions
  - `WSL_SETUP.md` - WSL-specific setup instructions
  - `MULTIPLE_ENVIRONMENTS.md` - Guide for managing multiple development environments

- Created automation scripts
  - `setup-dev-environment.sh` - Automates the installation of dependencies and setup process
  - `start-dev.sh` - Simple script to start the application in development mode

- Setup process includes:
  - Installation of required dependencies (Python, pip, Node.js, npm)
  - Creation of Python virtual environment
  - Installation of Python and Node.js packages
  - Database initialization
  - Option to create sample personas

- The setup is designed to be compatible with existing development environments
  - Uses isolated virtual environment
  - Database path can be customized
  - Port can be specified when starting the application

Next steps:
- Test the setup process on different WSL instances
- Document any additional dependencies or configuration needed for specific features
- Consider creating a database migration script for updating existing installations
