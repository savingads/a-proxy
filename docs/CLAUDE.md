# A-Proxy Development Setup Progress

## 2025-04-08: Initial WSL Development Environment Setup

- Created comprehensive development environment setup documentation
  - `SETUP_DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md` - Detailed manual setup instructions
  - `WSL_SETUP.md` - WSL-specific setup instructions
  - `MULTIPLE_ENVIRONMENTS.md` - Guide for managing multiple development environments

- Created automation scripts
  - `setup-dev-environment.sh` - Automates the installation of dependencies and setup process
  - `start-dev.sh` - Simple script to start the application in development mode

- Setup process includes:
  - Installation of required dependencies (Python, pip, Node.js, npm)
  - Creation of Python virtual environment
  - Installation of Python and Node.js packages
  - Database initialization
  - Option to create sample personas

- The setup is designed to be compatible with existing development environments
  - Uses isolated virtual environment
  - Database path can be customized
  - Port can be specified when starting the application

Next steps:
- Test the setup process on different WSL instances
- Document any additional dependencies or configuration needed for specific features
- Consider creating a database migration script for updating existing installations
