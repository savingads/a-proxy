# TypeScript Fix & Development Setup

## TypeScript Fix

The issue with the `mcp-client-example.ts` file was that it was using ES Module import syntax (`import {}`) while the project was configured to use CommonJS format. The error was:

```
[ts Error] Line 13: Cannot find module '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk' or its corresponding type declarations.
```

This has been fixed by using CommonJS require syntax instead:

```javascript
// The examples directory uses CommonJS format (type: "commonjs" in package.json)
const { Client, SocketClientTransport } = require('@modelcontextprotocol/sdk');
```

## Development Environment Setup

To run the MCP client example without Docker, I've created a few helper scripts to set up and run the development environment.

### Running the Development Environment

1. First, set up the development environment:

   ```bash
   ./setup-dev-environment.sh
   ```
   
   This script:
   - Creates a normalized `persona-service` directory with the necessary files
   - Sets up a Python virtual environment
   - Installs required Python dependencies
   - Fixes any syntax errors in the Python files
   - Sets up the MCP client environment with npm dependencies

2. Run the development environment:

   ```bash
   ./run-dev-without-docker-fixed.sh
   ```
   
   This script:
   - Starts the Persona Service API on port 5050
   - Runs the MCP client example with ts-node
   - Cleans up processes on exit

### Directory Structure

The development environment uses the following directory structure:

- `persona-service/` - The main service directory (without extra suffixes)
- `persona-mcp-server/examples/` - Contains the MCP client example

### Notes on Git Submodule

The original project was using Git submodules with inconsistent naming which caused confusion and setup errors. The scripts try to normalize this, but if you need to work with the actual submodule setup, you may need to address some Git configuration issues.

For most development purposes, the scripts provided handle the files directly without requiring submodule configuration to be correct.
