# Fixing the TypeScript Error in MCP Client Example

The MCP client example in the persona-service submodule has a TypeScript syntax error. This file needs to be fixed in the source repository and then the submodule reference needs to be updated.

## The Issue

In the file `examples/mcp-client/mcp-client-example.ts`, there are syntax errors with missing commas and incorrect import syntax:

```typescript
// Import directly from the SDK main package
import { Client SocketClientTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk';

// Function to access a resource
async function accessResource(client: Client uri: string) { ... }
```

## How to Fix It

### 1. Direct Approach (Quick Fix)

You have two options:

**Option A: Fix in the source repository**
1. Navigate to the source repository (not the submodule)
2. Fix the TypeScript file
3. Commit and push the changes
4. Update the submodule reference in this project

**Option B: Work inside the submodule**
1. Navigate into the submodule: `cd persona-service-new`
2. Make changes, commit, and push them
3. Navigate back to the main repository
4. Update the submodule reference: `git add persona-service-new && git commit -m "Update submodule"`

### 2. The Corrected Code

Here's the corrected code for the TypeScript file:

```typescript
// Import directly from the SDK main package
import { Client, SocketClientTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk';

// Function to access a resource
async function accessResource(client: Client, uri: string) {
  // Rest of the function...
}
```

### 3. Testing the Fix

To test if the TypeScript fix works:

1. Navigate to the submodule's MCP client example directory: `cd persona-service-new/examples/mcp-client`
2. Compile the TypeScript: `tsc`
3. Verify that no TypeScript errors are reported

## Why the Error Isn't Showing as a Change

Git submodules reference a specific commit in another repository. When you modify files inside a submodule:

1. The changes need to be committed within the submodule first
2. Then the parent repository needs to update its reference to point to the new submodule commit

This is what makes them powerful but also occasionally complex to work with.
